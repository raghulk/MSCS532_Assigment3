Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we conclude:
1.	Randomized Quicksort:
  • Provides better average-case performance than deterministic Quicksort.
  • Handles edge cases (sorted/reverse-sorted) better.
  • Slightly higher overhead due to random pivot selection.
2.	Hashing with Chaining:
  • Efficient under low load factors but slows with high element count.
  • Effective collision handling with chaining.
  • Load factor management is crucial for maintaining efficiency.

Key Takeaways:
  • Choosing the right algorithm depends on input characteristics and expected performance trade-offs.
  • Randomization techniques can provide robust solutions in sorting.
  • Hash table efficiency heavily relies on collision handling and resizing strategies.
